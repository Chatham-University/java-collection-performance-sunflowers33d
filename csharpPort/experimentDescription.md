## Collections Demo
As well as porting the Java code to C#, I have added the ability to run the four tests (**Array**, **Vector**, **LinkedList** and **ArrayList**) as many times as the user desires, and the result of each test is printed to the console after all tests have concluded. Furthermore, the average and maximum (slowest) times for a specific test are printed.

Example:

    All tests finished, printing all results...
    All Array tests:
    0.93
    0.977
    0.939
    Maximum Array value of all runs: 0.977
    Average of all Array values: 0.948666666666667
    All Vector tests:
    1.217
    1.245
    1.153
    Maximum Vector value of all runs: 1.245
    Average of all Vector values: 1.205
    All LinkedList tests:
    9.884
    11.424
    11.452
    Maximum LinkedList value of all runs: 11.452
    Average of all LinkedList values: 10.92
    All ArrayList tests:
    11.161
    11.034
    10.905
    Maximum ArrayList value of all runs: 11.161
    Average of all ArrayList values: 11.0333333333333
